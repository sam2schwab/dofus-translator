# Dofus Translator
This is a chrome extension that allows users to translate specific terms from the game Dofus that are present on the current tab. 

## How to use
**WIP** - This extension is not yet on the Chrome Web Store.

*You can still clone the code, run the setup scripts and install it in chrome yourself but it's reccomended for technical users only.*

Once the extension is installed, pin it in your chrome taskbar, then follow these steps once you are on a page you want to translate:
- Click the extension icon (this will translate Dofus specific terms)
- Translate the page using google translate (right-click, translate to english)

There you go, the page is translated!

Happy questing!
